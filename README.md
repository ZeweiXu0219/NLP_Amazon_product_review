## Summary
This project was built in 2020. My teammates and I decided to try to use **BERT** as the word Embedding model. However, we failed at that time so we just use word2vec to finish project quickly.

Recently, I try to restart this project and try to review and change some parts and details of our project. What make me excited is I finish the model training and I do imporve the model performance.

I will describe what I have change below:
1. I use substitute word2vec to BERT as the model to do the word embedding.
2. I try GRU model and compare the result of the LSTM(the original).
3. I try to change the parameters and the result become better.
